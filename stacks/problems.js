// Next greater element
/**
Problem Statement: Given a circular integer array A, return the next greater element for every element in A. The next greater element for an element x is the first element greater than x that we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this element.

Examples:

Example 1: 

Input: N = 11, A[] = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9}

Output: 10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10
